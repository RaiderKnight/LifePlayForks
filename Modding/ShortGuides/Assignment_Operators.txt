Assignment operators are used to modify the values of float variables and stats. They are:
+= : add
-= : deduct
*= : multiply
/= : divide
= : set (for a float variable)
=> : set (for a actor stat)

Examples:
    CurrentCompanion:attractiontoplayer += Random(0, 2)
    count += 1
    martial *= 2
    Salary /= 2
    jobperformance => 50 // use '=>' instead of just '=' because job performance is a actor stat
    count = 0 // use '=' instead of '=>' because count is not an actor stat but a local float variable
    count += 1
