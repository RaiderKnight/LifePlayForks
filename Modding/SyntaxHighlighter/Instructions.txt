INSTALLING

Since you're interested in installing the Notepad++ highlighter, let's presume you have Notepad++ installed. Right?

Go to the program's menu: Language/Define your language
In the window that pops up click "import". Find the .xml file and import it. 
Import *either* the darkMode or the normal file not both!
Restart NP++! 

From now on, every LP filetype you open will open with the syntax highlighter enabled.


CHANGING LAYOUT

The main purpose of a syntax highligher consists of
- making sure blocks are collapsible (eg If-Elseif-Else-Endif, Random blocks can be collapsed)
- applying specific font choices and colors (styles) to specific lists of keywords
- also applying specific styles for comments, quotes etc.

You can easily change the styles of this highlighter by opening it in the Define your language window and clicking on any button called "Styler".

If the highlighter gets updated with new function keywords and you wish to keep your personal styling choices,
	- export your current version of the highlighter first. This'll create an .xml file like the one offered here.
	- remove your current version in the Define your language window
	- copy-paste anything from your previous version that's between the <styles> and </styles> tags to the new one's xml
	- import the new .xml
	
Currently the keywords lists are
	1. block types
	2. command functions
	3. condition functions
	4. special variables
	5. stats
	6. locations
	7. moods
	8. tags
    
    
DARK MODE

The dark mode file sets all background colors to BLACK. There is no transparent option.
If you want another back color open the "Styles" window of NP++ and set a global override for the back color.

Current Version: Supports up to LP 3.17
