ForcedTrigger()

USE:
Returns whether a scene was force triggered with an action that has the SCENE_ALWAYS field filled (which overrides the conditions at the top of a scene). Use it to know if the scene was consciously triggered by the player or randomly triggered.

TYPE: Condition, non-Ref
RETURNS: bool
THEME: Scenes
COMPARE: sceneStart

EXAMPLE:
	The "organize_a_house_party.lpaction" file has the following field filled:
		SCENE_ALWAYS: house_party
		
	And the house_party.lpscene consults it like this:
		PlayerHosting = ForcedTrigger()

		sceneStart()

		If PlayerHosting
			"My preparations are all done. It's time to welcome the guests!"
			Player(Happy):: "Come in, everyone! Don't be shy. Everything's ready."
		Else
			"My phone rang! It's <Host.name>. I wonder what <Host.he_or_she> is calling me for?"
			...
		Endif
