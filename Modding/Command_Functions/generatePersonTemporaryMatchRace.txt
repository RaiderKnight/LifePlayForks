Actor.generatePersonMatchRace()

USE: 
Generate a new actor that matches the racial preset of another person (for example, to generate a relative of an NPC, but only seen in one scene). The actor generated using this method will be temporary (unless you later use MakePermanent() ) , meaning they will be deleted and forgotten about after the current scene ends and are not usable for some functions that only work with permanent actors.

TYPE: Command, Ref
RETURNS: Actor
THEME: Actor Creation
COMPARE: generatePerson

EXAMPLE:
    Actor = Actor2.generatePersonTemporaryMatchRace()  // If Actor2 is east asian, Actor will also be east asian
    Actor.dress()
    Actor.show(2)
    
    exchangeContact(Actor) // this will fail because this isn't a permanent actor
