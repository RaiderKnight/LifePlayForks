Actor.generateRelativeMatchRace()

USE: 
Generate a new relative actor that matches the racial preset of another person (for example, to generate my relative). The actor generated using this method will be permanent right away, meaning they will remain after the current scene ends and are usable for some functions that only work with permanent actors.
