WHERE

USE:
WHERE is mostly used to enter a condition at the top of a scene, affecting its random triggering depending on the player's location.
However, it can also be used as a command in the rest of the scene script, returning the player's location.
Available locationIDs can be found in Docs/Lists/all_wheres.txt

TYPE: Condition, non-Ref
RETURNS: locationID (string)
THEME: Scenes, Location
COMPARE: isAtHome, WHAT, WHEN

EXAMPLE: 
	Title = "shop assistant"
	If WHERE == bank
		Title = "cashier"
	Elseif WHERE == bar || WHERE == nightclub
		Title = "bartender"
	Endif
	"It's my lucky day. I found myself being served by a <New_Person.handsome_or_cute> <Title>."
