getPerson(optional bool/tag)

USE:

Get a random person in your current game (i.e. could be anyone that has 
been created with GeneratePerson() or GeneratePersonTemporary() then 
MakePermanent() ). 

Optional parameters:

Boolean (true/false): to filter for whether their contact has been exchanged 
to you or not.

Tag (any): to filter for persons that have the given tag assigned.
The tag command was introduced with LifePlay 2.18 and can be used to iterate over 
all persons with a certain tag.

getPerson() will only return a specific person once for a scene. So you can use it to 
iterate though all persons in the game (omit the parameter), all you have in your 
contacts (set parameter to true), all persons you don't have exchanged contacts 
with (set to false) or all persons with a specific tag.
