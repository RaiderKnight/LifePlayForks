WHAT

USE:
WHAT is mostly used to enter a condition at the top of a scene, affecting its random triggering depending on what the player's doing.
However, it can also be used as a command in the rest of the scene script, returning the player's current activity.
Available actionIDs can be found in the different files contained in the "Actions" folder in modules.

TYPE: Condition, non-Ref
RETURNS: actionID (string)
THEME: Scenes, Activity
COMPARE: WHAT, WHEN

EXAMPLE:
	If WHAT == socialize && WHERE == nightclub
		"It shouldn't be surprising that when you talk to random strangers at a nightclub, somebody will think you're just hitting on people."
		Jealous = generatePerson()
		Jealous.dress()
		Jealous.show()
		Jealous(Angry)::"Stay away from my <Player.boyfriend_or_girlfriend>, you <Player.creep_or_skank>!"
	Endif
