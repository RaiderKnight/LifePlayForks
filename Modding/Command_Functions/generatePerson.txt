generatePerson()
generatePerson(preset1, preset2, ..., presetN)

USE: 
Generate a new actor. If nothing inside the bracket: completely random actor. Or you can specify the presets to blend into this new actor. The actor generated using this method will be permanent right away, meaning they will remain after the current scene ends and are usable for some functions that only work with permanent actors.

TYPE: Command, Non-Ref
RETURNS: Actor
THEME: Actor Creation
COMPARE: generatePersonTemporary, blendPreset

EXAMPLE:
    Actor = generatePerson()  // OR Actor = generatePerson(easterneuropean, twenties, fitness_model)
    Actor.dress()
    Actor.show(2)
    
    exchangeContact(Actor) // this will succeed because this is a permanent actor
