WHEN

USE:
WHEN is mostly used to enter a condition at the top of a scene, affecting its random triggering depending on what time of day it is.
However, it can also be used as a command in the rest of the scene script, to return the time of day in a float.

TYPE: Command, non-Ref
RETURNS: float
THEME: Scenes, Time
COMPARE: WHAT, WHERE

EXAMPLE:
	If WHEN > 21 || WHEN < 4
		time = "late"
	Elseif WHEN < 9
		time = "early"
	Endif
	"My neighbour's having <Neighbour.p> stereo on, and it's so loud the bass can be heard from a block away! I've got a good mind to tell <Neighbour.o> that I'm calling the police if <Neighbour.s> ever makes such noise this <time> again!"
